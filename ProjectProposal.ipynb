The numbers representing the attributes tends to be rather small, so perhaps we might need to adjust them for a smoother and visually more apparent results. To better answer our question, we might also need to combine various attributes and see if a certain combination makes it out better among the songs. As a result, this will call for an addition of a new column, or possibly several new columns, for each song. Each column would thus represent a combination. The process of choosing the combinations of attributes will have to come after the initial comparison among individual attributes. After comparing them one-on-one, we might perhaps decide that a combination of the top three attributes is best. Then, we can decide whether ranking the songs by this combination, or some other, results in a nearly exact or extremely similar ranking as our initial data.\n",

    "If our analysis and hypothesis are correct, this project will help decode what makes a song a hit, and therefore can help people in the industry create songs that can succeed. This will make it much easier for music industry professionals to categorize music based on the features being analyzed, and then optimize certain features for each song’s benefit. We generally expect that higher danceability will lead to popularity, but if that is incorrect, we will simply learn what features actually do make a song popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may experience a number of pitfalls or confounds with our project because our hopes with the results are for predictive use, we can never be 100% sure that music consumption in the future will follow the same trends of the past.  We are also only using a dataset the covers a few years, which makes the predictive correlation a bit weaker. Also as far as our methods, we have to manually match up songs from the charts to the features list. Another potential problem is that since we are only using Spotify, there are songs from certain popular artists that aren’t in their data thus the data might be skewed to certain genres. For example, Taylor Swift isn’t on Spotify thus her type of music isn’t fully represented compared to the abundance of hip-hop, pop, etc.\n",
