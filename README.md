Data Analysis of the different atributes that make a song popular using data
from Spotify song charts from 2004 to 2018. Songs are ranked by total number of
streams, which also implies that popularity of a song can be seen through total
number of streams it has.

Anaylsis and data visualizations are shown in NextHit.ipynb

More details on project could be found in ProjectProposal.ipynb (Final project
results may differ from initial ideas in proposal, but the proposal carries the
inital ideas)

Data has been scraped from website and saved to a csv file to avoid scraping
every time the notebook is run. But if needed can rescrape data using the cells
under the Data Cleaning section.
